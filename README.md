# Projects
### Hi there!

I'm _**Miles Macchiaroli**_, A Computer Networking Student that is facinated about technology, and its impact on the world around me. 

Here you will find small, Personal Projects that either help with the monotonous tasks in my day, or ones that leverage the power of AI to solve the worlds greatest problems.

Some of my Skills are:
* Audio/Visual Production
* Technical Theatre
* Network Administration
* Web Systems Configuration
* VPS Configuration
* Mechanical Engineering
* Robotics
* Computer Repair

I enjoy Writing Scripts and creating new things with the technologies I learn.

_If you'd like to see some of my actual work and procedures, please get in touch. Much of my development at the time is closed-source and not publically available. (hoping to change that soon!)_
