# Projects
### Heyo

I'm _**Miles**_, A ~~Computer Networking Student that is facinated about technology, and its impact on the world around me~~ guy that does things. 

~~Here you will find small, Personal Projects that either help with the monotonous tasks in my day, or ones that leverage the power of AI to solve the worlds greatest problems.~~ an old professor made me put that, these are snippets of snippets of classes and some things I'd like to reference quickly. 

Some of my Skills are:
* _Redacted_
* sleep

uhm [bash/COMP3550/Lab1/algs.py](https://github.com/maccmiles/projects/blob/master/bash/COMP3550/Lab1/algs.py) is probably the only 'cool' thing that does code and stuff, made as a lab for a class when I used to care.

Otherwise, _bash/_ has a few snippets of manual account creation and notifications for systems that aren't in ansible for whatever reason.


something, something, getting in touch, please visit [website](https://miles.macchiaro.li)
