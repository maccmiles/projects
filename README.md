# Projects
### Hi there!

I'm _**Miles Macchiaroli**_, A Computer Networking Student that is facinated about technology, and its impact on the world around me. 

Here you will find small, Personal Projects that either help with the monotonous tasks in my day, or ones that leverage the power of AI to solve the worlds greatest problems.

Some of my Skills are:

I enjoy Writing Scripts and creating new things with the technologies I learn.
